This example project produces, internally, an initial reference image with an affine direction matrix and a translation defining its physical space.   We then transform this image with a known affine transformation.  We propagate the known affine transformation back into the image header and compute the index space and physical space intensity difference.  The index space intensity difference between these two images should be large while the physical space intensity difference should be small.  We test this, first, without using any I/O and verify that the intensity difference is due only to interpolation.  We then write the resampled image with an affine matrix in its header out into three file formats: nii.gz, mhd and nrrd.  We read these back in and perform the same intensity difference test.   The results of this test show:

Average difference in index space : 0.806789      # as expected 
Average difference in phys space mhd : 0.0167048  # correct
Average difference in phys space nrrd : 0.0167048 # correct, kind of. 
Average difference in phys space nii : 0.233459   # wrong.

This makes it appear as though nrrd and mhd do the same thing, but they don't.  Observe the direction matrices:

mhd header direction matrix is correct:  (determinant = -1.1 ) 
-1.095 0.1
0.05 1

nii.gz header direction matrix not correct: (determinant -0.99854)
-0.997362 0.0725856
0.0725856 0.997362

nrdd header direction matrix not correct: (determinant = -1 ) 
-0.998959 0.0995037
0.0456146 0.995037


So something different is happening in each case.   This can be seen by viewing the output images:  

zfixed.mhd		
zfixed_resampled.mhd	
zfixed_resampled.nrrd
zfixed_resampled.nii.gz	

in a viewer such as ITK-SNAP.
